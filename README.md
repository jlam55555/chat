A real-time online chat application
![Chat Screenshot](http://s21.postimg.org/jiowtr1yv/chat.png)

#### Description
This was my first [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) application. I used the [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) and [Socket.io](http://socket.io/) dependencies to help me out to create a real-time chat service with websockets!

#### Features
- Real-time chatting with websockets provided by Socket.io
- Modern, clean UI with FontAwesome icons
- No limit on number of users (theoretically)
- List of users to see who is online
- Photo (click the camera icon) and link (automatically detected) sending
- Colorful bubbles from others with clear name indication
- No duplicate names to avoid confusion
